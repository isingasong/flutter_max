          'When your aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you’ve grown old, even at 20; but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism, there’s hope you may die young at 80.'),

      content:
          'When we are appreciating the passionate melody of Gloria Estefan, we could hardly imagine that she could return to the stage after her paralysis. In the year 1990, this Cuban singer was knocked down in a traffic accident, and the doctor declared that she might never walk again. But Gloria did not give up and kept up constant exercising. Just one year after the disaster, she stood up again and presented this encouraging song at the Atlanta Olympics'),

      content:
          'Whenever I think of Gloria, I can’t help recalling my memory seven years ago, when I first entered university. Naturally shy, ordinary looking, average scores in study, just like an ugly duckling, I seemed to be the least outstanding one in my class. And the successive failures in the beginning led me into despair. “Am I destined to take the back seat to others?” Unwilling to submit to the fate, I paid more efforts on my study as well as many other activities, film dubbing, recital, drama„ cause I just want to catch every little opportunity to prove myself. Constant effort yields sure success. Thanks to the competition, I received some awards and most of all, I gained the courage and confidence to face any difficulties in my life journey.'),

      content:
          'One night, I complained to my mom about the lack of time. Finally she said,＂you are short of time just because you waste precious minutes on complaints and anxiety. The point is, no matter how full your schedule is, if you try really hard, you can always fit in some thing more.＂ It is the same with filling the jar. Even if you place a dozen fist-sized rocks and a bucket of gravel into the jar, there is still space for sand and water between the rocks and grave'),

      title: 'Helen Keller',
      content:
          'The lack of time is just the excuse for my negligence of every single minute. I believe that the great dividing line between success and failure can be expressed in six words,＂I did not have enough time.＂The fact is I do have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein. The point is I have never touched upon the real meaning of life which lies in snatching, seizing and enjoying every minute of it. No idleness, no delay, no procrastination, no complaint! It is during my moments of complaining or hesitation that my destiny is shaped. Once I make full use of every moment, I believe that, my worries will be gradually cut down to nothing. Time is the most valuable of all our possessions, but the most perishable as well. As Henry David Thoreau said,＂You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment.＂'),

          'Years ago as a little girl, when I came across some old and disabled beggars on the road, I\'d donate some pocket money to them, happily thinking I was helping. s I have grown older, I\'ve found the number of beggars has grown larger and they are more diverse. They appear in every corner of the city, on the overbridge, on the street, near restaurants, and even at your door. In contrast with the old days, it seems like the situation with beggars today is more complicated, which has made me hesitate before deciding whether to help them or not.'),

      content:
          'Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today I want to tell you a story about one of my friends, a lovely and smart girl who is always ready to help others. Being our grade leader, she is good at both work and study. In many people\'s opinion, she is excellent and perfect. But one day she told me she was gloomy and insecure. People around her considered her outstanding and flawless, thinking she could handle everything. But the more she thought about herself, the more disappointed she became. She found that she was far from perfection. Last week, she didn’t do well in her French quiz, and the day before yesterday, she was late for a conference. She felt depressed and frustrated, because she failed to be a perfect girl without any mistakes.I was surprised to hear that for I thought she had every reason to be confident. However, the expectation of perfection has become a burden to her. I told her no one could be perfect and I suggested she find her own position.In fact, people are so eager to be perfect that they demand too much of themselves. They want to be special and unique, and they want to have no defects or weaknesses. However, we can never avoid mistakes and errors. It’s impossible for us to be a superman or a superwoman. No matter how successful we are, there are always some flaws. If we hold that everything should be perfect, we would be overcritical.My friend now has changed her attitude. She accepts her shortcomings but still keeps a positive outlook. She is even more active and doesn’t allow the mistakes to hinder her pursuit of excellence. And I think that’s the way we should be！That’s all. Thank you!   '),

Everyone should know that there is only one earth, lfwe go on treating her like this, it won\'t be fit for us to live in any longer. It\'s time for us to love her, take good care of her and cure her. We should save the earth so as to save ourselves.'),
